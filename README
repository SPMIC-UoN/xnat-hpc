This repository contains code that supports the interaction of XNAT
with the HPC via the pipeline functionality.

The methodology is:
 - Define pipeline that runs a command, passing it the URL of the XNAT host
   the project, subject and experiment, and the name of a command to run on the HPC
 - This command logs into the HPC via ssh and executes the command with the
   XNAT arguments. This is sufficient to allow the remote HPC command to download
   required data from XNAT and upload results after completion
 - Passwordless key-based SSH login is required for this to work. There is a script to start
   ssh-agent as the XNAT server user, add the login key and write the agent PID/socket
   information to a text file which is then sourced by the pipeline command to 
   enable it to log in to the HPC via SSH without interaction
 - This assumes that root on the XNAT server can be trusted otherwise arbitrary code
   execution on the HPC is trivial
